# Morsera Frontend

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start a local dev server.

```
yarn install
cp .env.sample .env
yarn start
```

Then:

- If HTTPS is used (by default enabled)
  - Open your Safe app locally (by default via https://localhost:3000/) and accept the SSL error.
- Go to the [Safe web interface](https://app.safe.global)
- Create your test safe
- Go to Apps -> Manage Apps -> Add Custom App
- Paste your localhost URL, default is https://localhost:3000/
- You should see Safe App Starter as a new app
- Develop your app from there
